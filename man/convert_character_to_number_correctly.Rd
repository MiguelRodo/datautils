\title{Fix Excel decimal symbol errors}
\usage{
convert_character_to_number_correctly(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character vector. Column of data.}

\item{decimal_symbol_orig}{"." or ",".}
}
\description{
Occasionally numbers are read in from Excel as characters
and R does not correctly convert these characters to numbers. This function
splits each number-as-character into integer and fraction parts
(around whatever decimal indicator is present) and adds them. NOTE: Please do
check output.
}
\details{
This function corrects (most) errors arising from
importing an Excel/CSV file that was created on a system
that uses a period (or full stop, ie. ".") as the decimal separator.

Note that it appears that if an entire column was
read in from Excel where each entry has the same number of numbers
and has the decimal in the same place, then readr::read_csv (at least)
will for some reason read in the column without the comma at all. This function
will not fix that.

\examples{
# vector of data (as if from Excel)
x <- c("1,32", "1", "0,23", "3,23E-2", NA)
x_period <- c("1.32", "1", "0.23", "3.23E-2", NA)
# original data alongside corrected data
data.frame(orig = x, replacement = convert_character_to_number_correctly(x = x))
}
